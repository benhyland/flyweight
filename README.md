Flyweight
=========

This is an design exercise and experiment in reading from a backing buffer in a reasonably structured way, with low garbage.

A more sensible approach on the JVM might look something like [packed objects](http://duimovich.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/packed-objects-in-java.html).

A more sensible approach in general would be to write code in C instead.

A better API could probably be given by using bytecode generation rather than plain Scala.

TODO PERHAPS

- consider arrays
- consider nested structures
- give more complex examples
- implement other primitives
- try an off-heap backing buffer
